# Indonesian Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression 💬
## Project Overview:
### This project performs sentiment analysis on Indonesian text data using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The analysis is implemented using a combination of Jupyter Notebook for data processing and training, and Streamlit to deploy an interactive web application.

# Key Features:
- 🔍 Sentiment Analysis: Predicting whether the sentiment of a given text is positive, negative, or neutral.
- 📚 Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression implemented with Scikit-learn.
- 🛠 Tools and Technologies:
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model training.
  - Streamlit for building an interactive web interface.
  - Scikit-learn for Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorization.
  - Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation.
    
# Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is from the IndoNLP repository, specifically the [SMSA Document Sentiment Dataset](https://github.com/IndoNLP/indonlu/tree/master/dataset/smsa_doc-sentiment-prosa). , which contains Indonesian text with labeled sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
